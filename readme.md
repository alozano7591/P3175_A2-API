# PROG3175 Distributed Applications
## By Alfredo Lozano

This is the initial project setup for assignment 2 of this course.
The project goes over converting ASP.NET Core 8 API to Node.js with Express and SQLite Integration.

# Some pointers on getting a basic node api
These notes are made for myself so I don't forget what I did when I look back at this project later.

## Setup and checks
- Ensure that terminal is cmd and not powershell
- check that node installed `node --version`
- check that npm installed `npm --version`

## Initialize project
- Initialize node `npm init`
   - follow steps (defaults are fine)
- Install express `npm install express`
